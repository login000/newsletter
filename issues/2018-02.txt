hello and welcome to the tilde newsdesk. please help yourself to some
of the most exciting recent happenings on tilde.town.

A TOWNIE IN NEED
our friend ~cel finds themself in a tough situation. we have started a
fundraiser to try to provide them with financial support. if you can spare
any money it would be very much appreciated. the fundraiser page is at
https://www.gofundme.com/pitch-in-for-a-townie.

DISCORD SERVER!
did you know that tilde.town has a discord server? I did not, but now I
do! you can access it at https://discord.gg/qy53Bf.

MINECRAFT SERVER!
on the subject of gameing, we also have a minecraft server! wow! you can
access it at 206.255.129.18 but you'll also need modpacks to play. for
more info, check out the thread on bbj. to access bbj, type bbj at the
terminal. thank you so much to ~desvox for setting this up!

exciting updates to feels engine this month come from endorphant who
writes:

~ FEELS ENGINE UPDATES ~

vilmibm helped me out to get gopher support in the feels engine; you now
have the option of cross-posting to gopher. if you don't already have
gopher set up, enabling gopher support in the feels engine should
automatically create the directory structure for your gopher hole. gopher
is a pre-www internet protocol that mimics a directory structure instead of
the hyperlink format of html; tilde town has a gopher server that you can
check out with a gopher-compatible browser at gopher://tilde.town (for more
deets, check out the gopher page on the ~town wiki:
http://tilde.town/wiki/gopher.html )

rainbow menus! you can now enable colorful menus, which can both improve
legibility of long list displays, and also make your terminal more visually
exciting! i'm interested in how readable the rainbow menus are with your
terminal environment; if the colors are hard on your eyes, please let me
know so i can consider adjustments for a future update! there's a github
issue for that here: https://github.com/modgethanc/ttbp/issues/5

pub/nopub toggling! this has been a long overdue feature, but if you are
publishing your posts to web/gopher, there's now an option within the
interface to let you toggle whether or not individual posts get published
outside of the tilde.town shell environment. posts marked 'nopub' will not
get written to html/gopher, but will still be readable by other townies
from the feels engine. by default, posts are always published, but if
you mark a post a 'nopub' afterwards, it will be immediately unpublished
from html/gopher. likewise, if a nopub post gets reverted to a published
post, it will get immediately written back to html/gopher.

if you aren't publishing your posts at all, this menu won't be available to
you at all, because your posts will never be published. also, if you are
currently publishing, set a bunch of nopubs, then switch off publishing
altogether, your nopubs list will be preserved; this means that if you then
turn publishing on later, your nopubs will remain unpublished.

there's probably some hiccups with this most recent update (as usual,
because i am lazy/bad at testing my code <_<), so please send me mail or
pop into #ttbp on irc if you're having problems or have questions about
these updates!

wow, thanks ~endorphant!

we also have a couple of new tools from login who writes:

TILDECOIN I really wanted tilde.town to have an informal currency system
that could be used to exchange value. I created a program called `tcoin`
to make that happen.

When you first type `tcoin` in your prompt, you'll be told you haven't
initialised yet and that you'd need to run `tcoin init`. When you run
`tcoin init`, you'll be asked to create a passphrase. Once you've done
that, you'll be given 1000 tildecoins (every user is) and told that your
account was created successfully.

To log into `tcoin`, you type `tcoin on`, enter your passphrase, and wait
for a success/failure message. `tcoin` uses `whoami` to identify the
username and `scrypt` to authenticate with the passphrase. To discourage
brute-forcing and to make passwords of shorter length safer, scrypt takes
about a second or two to authenticate using your passphrase.

Once you've logged in, running `tcoin` will show your messages (which
includes details of transactions sent and received and any messages sent
along with each transaction) and balance.

To send some tildecoins, run `tcoin send <username> <amount> [<message>]`,
where <message> is optional, but <username> and <amount> are mandatory.
The amount must be a fixed point decimal number with two decimal places.
If it is not, it will be converted to one. For example, 314.159 will
become 314.15 and 42 will become 42.00.

You can send tildecoins to yourself as well. You can use this feature to
send yourself messages. You can use `tcoin` as a way of chatting with
someone as well, by sending a small amount of tildecoins back and forth
with a message included with each.

The first hack of tildecoin was performed by ~elly. I give her complete
credit with helping make `tcoin` safer. The most prominent hack till now
has been from ~selfsame. His program, ~selfsame/flowers, will steal 900
tildecoins from you if you run it. The whole reason passphrase-based
authentication was implemented was so that you could run `tcoin off` to
log off before running any programs whose nefariousness you weren't aware
of.

hus, it is good security practice to not run any untrusted programs while
you're logged into `tcoin`, and to run `tcoin off` and log off from
`tcoin` before running any programs.

If you want to review `tcoin`'s source code and compare the executable
with the compiled source code, you can find the source code at
/home/login/bin/src/tcoin/tcoin.cpp. You can compile it by running `g++
/home/login/bin/src/tcoin/tcoin.cpp -std=g++11`. This will create a file
called `a.out` in your current directory. Comapring this file with
/usr/local/bin/tcoin (this directory actually symlinks to
/home/login/bin/tcoin) will allow you to make sure that `tcoin` is safe to
run.

TILDEBOOK Tildebook is a directory for fello townies. Named after Facebook
and modelled after its original purpose of being a "book of faces", i.e.,
a directory of college students with their faces, tildebook takes the
simple approach of giving you a 144px by 144px space to put anything you
want.

The way it works is you create a web page that looks good in a 144px by
144px space in your public_html directory called tildebook_profile.html.
If your username is ~example, then your tildebook page should be
accessible at https://tilde.town/~example/tildebook_page.html. The
update_tildebook script runs every week and checks everyone's public_html
directory for the existence of a non-empty tildebook_page.html file. If
found, it hyperlinks to them on https://tilde.town/~login/tildebook/. If
you want to run the script yourself (for example, after having create a
tildebook_profile.html page), you can do so by running
/home/login/cronjobs/update_tildebook.

The URL https://tildebook.tk redirects to
https://tilde.town/~login/tildebook/ for now, but the latter will always
be available and should be used as the URL for the bookmark if you
bookmark tildebook.

Every time the command is run, the order of the townies shown is
randomised so that every townie has an equal chance of appearing at the
top of the page.

wow, thanks ~login!

the tilde.town spotlight is a section where we look at one user's ~ page.
this month we are checking out the wonderful work of tilde.town stalwart
~mio - http://tilde.town/~mio/

there's too much to love about this page. the origami is of course
stunning but the entire design is a real delight. it is simple, effective
and really striking. the page reflects the quality of ~mio's origami:
something stunning out of simple components. thanks ~mio!

a very sweet moment of reflection this month comes to us from ~wuz:

    "try to detach your sense of worth with how situations end up.
    the stigma around failure stems from our cultural feeling that ability
    isn't the same as worth, which just isn't true"
